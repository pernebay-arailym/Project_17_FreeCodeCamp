# Data Analysis with Python Projects

Welcome to the repository for my Data Analysis with Python projects completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification. Each project showcases different aspects of data analysis, from basic statistics to data visualization.

## Projects

### 1. Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
This project involves calculating mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of a 3x3 matrix derived from a list of nine numbers.

**Code Overview:**
- Input: List of nine numbers.
- Output: Dictionary with statistical measures along different axes and the flattened matrix.

### 2. Demographic Data Analyzer
Analyze demographic data from the Adult dataset to derive insights such as average age of men, percentage of people with a Bachelor's degree, and the percentage of people earning more than 50K based on their education level.

**Code Overview:**
- Input: `adult.data.csv` file.
- Output: Dictionary with various demographic statistics.

### 3. Medical Data Visualizer
Visualize medical examination data using categorical and heatmap plots to find correlations and trends in the data.

**Code Overview:**
- Input: `medical_examination.csv` file.
- Output: Categorical and heatmap plots.

### 4. Page View Time Series Visualizer
Visualize time series data of freeCodeCamp forum page views using line, bar, and box plots to identify trends and seasonal patterns.

**Code Overview:**
- Input: `fcc-forum-pageviews.csv` file.
- Output: Line plot, bar plot, and box plots.

### 5. Sea Level Predictor
Predict future sea levels using historical data and linear regression. The project includes creating scatter plots and lines of best fit for the given data.

**Code Overview:**
- Input: `epa-sea-level.csv` file.
- Output: Scatter plot with lines of best fit.
